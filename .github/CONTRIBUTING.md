# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this Hytale mod! To keep things consistent and
maintainable we have a few rules in place. Please read them before submitting
any pull request!

## General Rules

- Be respectful and constructive in discsussions.
- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Test your changes before submitting!!!!

## AI Guidelines

We do **NOT** accept pull requests that include AI generated content. This
includes, but is not limited to:

- Code that was generated by AI tools.
- AI-generated documentation, comments, or assets.
- Code that was drafted by an AI and lightly modified by a human. 

Pull requests that violate this rule will be **closed without review** and you
will be **banned** from contributing to the project in the future! Do not waste
your time, or your tokens.

## Compression

You may notice that some of our projects compress JSON data by removing the 
unnecessary whitespace and newline characters. This is done by a build step
and minified JSON should **never** be comitted to the repo directly. Please use
the source versions of files when making changes.

## Questions

If you're unsure whether a change is acceptable, reach out on Discord, or open
an issue and ask **before** starting work.
